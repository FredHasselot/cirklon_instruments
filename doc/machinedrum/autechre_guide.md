# Autechre 2008 Quaristice Live Set Guide

## What Are These Files?

Autechre (Rob Brown and Sean Booth) released the actual files from their legendary 2008 Quaristice tour. These are NOT just sounds or samples - they're the complete performance setups.

## What's Included

### Machinedrum Files (.syx)
- **Patterns**: Complete sequences, rhythms, parameter locks
- **Kits**: Sound patches with all synthesis parameters
- **Songs**: Full arrangement structures
- These are SYSEX files containing both the sounds AND the sequences

### Monomachine Files (.syx)
- Similar to MD: patterns, kits, and songs
- Synth patches and sequences used in performances

### Nord Modular G2 Files
- Complete synthesizer patches
- Complex modular routing setups

### MPC1000 Files
- PGM files (program files)
- WAV samples that can be used in any DAW
- Drum kits and sequences

## How to Use the Machinedrum Files

### Requirements
- Machinedrum (any model)
- MIDI interface
- SysEx transfer tool (SysEx Librarian, C6, etc.)

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the archive**
   - Get from [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/Ae2008LivePatches)
   - Unzip the files

2. **Find the MD files**
   - Look for `.syx` files in the Machinedrum folder
   - There should be multiple banks

3. **Load into your Machinedrum**
   ```
   IMPORTANT: This will overwrite your current patterns/kits!
   BACKUP YOUR DATA FIRST!
   ```

   - Connect MD via MIDI
   - On MD: GLOBAL → FILE → RECEIVE → ALL
   - Send the .syx file from your computer
   - Wait for transfer to complete

4. **Explore the content**
   - Patterns contain the actual sequences Autechre played live
   - Kits contain their custom sound designs
   - Songs show how they arranged tracks for performance

## Understanding the Content

### What You Get
- **NOT just presets** - These are complete compositions
- **Live performance data** - Exactly what they played on stage
- **Sound design** - Their actual synthesis parameters
- **Sequencing tricks** - Complex parameter locks and patterns

### Pattern Structure
- Each pattern is a loop/section from their live set
- Heavy use of parameter locks (p-locks)
- Complex polyrhythms and evolving sequences
- Probability and conditional trigs (if using X.11 firmware)

### Kit Design
- Heavily processed drum synthesis
- Unusual machine combinations
- Extreme parameter ranges
- Often using ROM machines for specific textures

## Tips for Learning

### Start Simple
1. Load one bank at a time
2. Play patterns in order to hear the progression
3. Study individual tracks to understand techniques

### Analyze Their Techniques
- **Mute/unmute** tracks to hear layers
- **Copy patterns** to new slots for experimentation
- **Study parameter locks** - Hold FUNC and turn knobs to see p-locks
- **Check the kits** - See how they programmed each sound

### What to Look For
- LFO usage for rhythmic modulation
- Extreme filter resonance settings
- Creative use of delay/reverb sends
- Pattern length variations for polyrhythms

## Don't Have a Machinedrum?

### Use the MPC WAV Files
- The MPC folder contains WAV samples
- Load these into any DAW or sampler
- Study the PGM files to see how they mapped samples

### Analyze with Tools
- Use [Sysex to MIDI Converter](https://github.com/carrierdown/elektron-sysex-to-midi)
- Convert patterns to MIDI for DAW analysis
- Study the structure without hardware

## Important Notes

### These Are NOT "Presets"
- They're complete artistic works
- Use them to learn, not to copy
- Respect the artistic intent

### Technical Complexity
- Some patterns may sound wrong on different firmware versions
- UW-specific features won't work on non-UW machines
- Some effects require specific routing

### Learning Resource
- Best viewed as a masterclass in MD programming
- Shows advanced techniques rarely documented
- Demonstrates the MD's full potential
